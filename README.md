# sourcebinder v1.0
This program aims to help you visualise your keyboard bindings in games that use the Source Engine by Valve Software.

It will create a file named `binds.cfg` in the directory of the .exe

This config file can be called from in-game by running the command `exec binds` from the console, so long as it is placed within the correct directory.

For Portal 1:

  `../Portal/hl2/cfg/binds.cfg`
  
For Portal 2:

  `../Portal 2/portal2/cfg/binds.cfg`
